https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/bmxV73x7h - a 400x400 canvas is created, and a sprite of a sad looking divorced man is drawn. A function is used to call him
onto the canvas.

https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/4aS9_Eyx5 - The sprite of the man being divorced can now frown if you press and hold left-click on the mouse.

https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/igL3ou1G9 - The sketch now draws a falling divorce paper at a random X variable from the top of the canvas, falling down to the 
bottom of the canvas.

https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/w89CXTsvA - Challenge 4 changes the code to where the divorce paper now respawns at a random position on the top of the canvas
if it either reaches the bottom of the canvas, or the player collects it. A background has also been added, meant to reflect the office the divorce lawyer is in.

https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/_290SuDZ5 - Challenge 5 alters challenge 4, in a way that makes it so the sprite now frowns when the player collects a divorce
paper, there isn't anything else different from challenege 4 than that.
